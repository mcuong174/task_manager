# Task Manager

- Create a task manager application where users can add, edit, and delete tasks.

- The application should have features such as task filtering, task priority, and task completion status.

## Requirements

- Task List: Display a list of tasks with relevant details, including task name, priority, and completion status.

- Task Creation: Allow users to create new tasks by providing a task name and selecting a priority level.

- Task Editing: Enable users to edit existing tasks, including modifying the task name, priority, and completion status.

- Task Deletion: Allow users to delete tasks from the task list.

- Task Filtering: Implement options to filter tasks based on priority or completion status.
  Responsive Design: Ensure the application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

## Optional Enhancements

- Task Sorting: Allow users to sort tasks based on different criteria, such as priority or creation date.

- Task Search: Implement a search functionality to enable users to search for specific tasks.

- User Authentication: Add user authentication to allow multiple users to have their own task lists.

- Data Persistence: Use a backend API or local storage to persist the task data across sessions.
